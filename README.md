# Sample Client Website

A theoritical client website design built on reactJS and styled components by Lama Dev from youtube.

[View his youtube channel (https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCOxWrX5MIdXIeRNaXC3sqIg/)

I got inspired by the design and built it from scratch again by replacing styled componenents with SASS to further hone my SASS skills.
